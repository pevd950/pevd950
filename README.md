## Hey, I'm Pablo ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack engineer focused on building software that's both practical and enjoyable to use. My experience covers backend development, UI design, and working with cloud services.

### What I like

* Building things
* Exploring new tech and tooling

Outside work, I spend my time listening to alt rock, tinkering with home automation, experimenting with AI, and accumulating way too many houseplants. I'm also into specialty coffee and hanging out with my two cats, Plato & Clea.

Feel free to reach out to collaborate or just talk tech, automation, or whatever else you're into!
