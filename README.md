## Hi there, I'm Pablo ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack engineer who loves building software. My background spans backend systems, cloud infrastructure, and UI development, but I'm most interested in the places where these intersect to create great user experiences.

### What I care about:
- Clean, maintainable code that others can understand and build upon
- Constantly exploring new tech, tools, and apps just because it's fun
- Solving real-world problems with practical solutions
- Building tools that make life easier for developers and users alike

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me vibing to some alt rock, tinkering with home automation projects,experimenting with AI, or following a new rabbit hole for the week. I've got way too many plants, love myself a good pour over â˜• have two lovely cats (Plato & Clea)

Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or just chat about tech, automation, or anything interesting!
